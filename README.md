# ansible-role-vscode

Ansible role for installing Visual Studio Code with extensions and configuring it with a slightly opinionated configuration.

## Requirements

None

## Role Variables

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

## Dependencies

None

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
     - avnes.ansible-role-vscode
```
